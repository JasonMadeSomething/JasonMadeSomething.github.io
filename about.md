Hey, I'm Jason. I'm an entry level programmer who is particularly enamored with the process of slamming my head into a keyboard until something workable comes out. Solving problems and coming up with solutions is one of my favorite things to do and I like to bring that love for problem solving to whatever job I do. What I lack in experience I feel I more than make up for it with curiosity and a drive (or rather, a need) to learn new things.

The last year and a half I have been learning Ruby and Javascript, though I was also taught Javascript in school. Some of my early projects were written in VBA and VB.NET as well. I've even taken a couple weeks to play around with Haskell. Learning languages and their various modes of seeing the world is a fun way to see problems from alternate angles. As a young programmer I like to think that right now I have a lot of bad habits and maybe some good ones, my goal is to work with professionals to cut back on those bad habits and develop new ones. While teaching myself to code has been an immensely rewarding experience, I now need to take the next step and start working in more demanding environments so that I can grow in to the programmer I know I can be.
