### I would rather be coding (but instead I'm blogging)

So this is my inaugural blog post. My hope is to use this space as a place where I can impotently gripe about my various frustrations and confusions as I learn to program and hopefully learn to program well. As much as I would rather be researching my issues on Stack Overflow or some IRC channel, I see the value in keeping a journal of my struggles (and successes if I'm feeling obnoxious). My hope is that this blog will function like a rubber duck that remembers to much and tells everyone my stupid thoughts. I can't see any downside. 

### Upcoming work

Right now I'm not working on any major projects other than getting this portfolio put together, though I do have a couple of potential projects in the pipeline that I can't wait to get started on. The first one will be using an old list of business identification numbers and using a screen scraper to verify if those businesses still exist. Another project I am looking at is to create a system that would allow the mail house that currently employs me to track the mail they send in the USPS system. It should be fairly interesting to work with a government system like that. One other project that I hope to be taking on has not been made entirely clear to me yet, but I know it involves using orders to calculate the correct input inventory needed to complete all products. My hope is that at least 1 or 2 of those projects pan out because I would really like something more interesting to do.
